**HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):**

- HTML is a standard markup language used to create and design web pages.
  It structures the content on the web, using a system of elements and tags.

**Creating an HTML Page from a Wireframe:**

- A wireframe is a visual representation of a web page's structure.
  To create an HTML page from a wireframe, you use HTML tags to represent different elements like headings, paragraphs, images, links, etc., based on the wireframe design.

**Markup Language:**

- A markup language is a system for annotating text to indicate its structure or presentation.
  HTML is an example of a markup language, where tags are used to define elements and their attributes.

**DOM (Document Object Model):**

- The DOM is a programming interface for web documents.
  It represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects, where each object corresponds to a part of the document, allowing scripts to dynamically modify the document content.

**Element / Tag:**

- In HTML, an element is a fundamental component that can define structure or content on a webpage.
  Elements are represented by tags, such as `<p>` for paragraphs or `<img>` for images.

**Attribute:**

- Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.
  They are always included in the opening tag and are used to modify or provide more details about the element.

**Purpose of HTML Tags:**

- Tags define the structure and content of a webpage.
  They include headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`), paragraphs (`<p>`), images (`<img>`), links (`<a>`), lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`), and more.
  Each tag serves a specific purpose in organizing and presenting content on the web.
